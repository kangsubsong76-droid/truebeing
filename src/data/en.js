            desc2: "The reality of the mind is an endless wave of energy—desire, pain, anxiety, fear. Since this phenomenon occurs naturally regardless of our will, the belief that we can suppress or control it is a complete 'illusion'. Fully stepping out of the mind is true freedom and authentic meditation."
